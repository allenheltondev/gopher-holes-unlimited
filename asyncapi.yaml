      Connection url for the WebSocket. When creating a new gopher, status updates are pushed in the form of WebSocket notifications.

      ### Authentication

      To connect to this WebSocket, you must get a valid auth token from the
      *create-test-jwt* lambda function from the [WebSocket microservice](https://github.com/allenheltondev/serverless-websockets). You can use the token in one of two
      ways:
        * As a query parameter on *$connect* called `auth_token`
        * As a comma separated value in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header
            * The `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header is required on connect. It must have a value of `websocket`. If using this header as the auth method, the value would be `websocket, <auth token>`

      ### Example Connection Url

      >     wss://ws.gopherholesunlimited.com?access_token=eyJhbG
