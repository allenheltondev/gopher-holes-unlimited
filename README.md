# Gopher Holes Unlimited Reference Guide

## Description
Welcome to the reference guide for how to build API first with Postman! This is the follow along guide to [my blog post](https://www.readysetcloud.io/blog/allen.helton/api-first-development-with-postman/), so if you want more detail on what you're looking at, hop over there!

## Objective
Introduce newbies to definine an API before writing any code. With [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](https://openapis.org), you can define all aspects of an api. The data shape, the endpoints, security (not included in this example), and expected responses.

When at all possible, you should use industry standard technology and specifications. OpenAPI is just that. It is used by major companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM.

Learning how to write in the spec not only provides the developer with a useful skillset, but it also provides other developers a familiar experience.

Postman stitches together the OAS definition with robust functionality like mock servers, web tests, and documentation right out of the box. The [blog post](https://www.readysetcloud.io/blog/allen.helton/api-first-development-with-postman/) walks you through how to set it up and start testing.

## Contents
In this repo you will find:
* OAS3.0 spec defining the *Gopher Holes Unlimited* API. It contains the endpoints, component schemas, and example responses
* 3 Postman Collections
    * Mock Server Collection
    * Documentation Collection
    * Test Suite/Automation Collection

The Postman collections are intended to be consumed from [Postman](https://postman.com) itself, and is highly recommended you import them into your workspace to get the full effect.

## Infrastructure
Below is an auto-generated [infrastructure diagram](https://www.readysetcloud.io/blog/allen.helton/the-5-types-of-architecture-diagrams/#the-infrastructure-diagram) describing the serverless API built by the SAM template in this repository. The resources outlined in the diagram below will be deployed into your AWS account.
